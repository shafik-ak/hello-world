# CDS Benchmarks

This directory contains some benchmarks to keep track of performance regressions
over time. Please note that these benchmarks are not intended to compare different
compiler backends.

## Run Benchmarks

Convenience NPM target:

```sh
npm run benchmark
```

Main benchmark script:

```sh
./benchmark/benchmarks.js --help
./benchmark/benchmarks.js --type table
```

## Adding new Benchmarks

**Recommendations:**
 - each benchmark should run > 1min
 - warmUpExecutions should be > 10% of executions

## Changing existing Benchmarks

 - do *NOT* change the identifier of a benchmark or history will be lost
 - you may change the number of executions and warm-up-executions
 - add a marker to the benchmark-result-repository (TODO: URL)
